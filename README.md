# Big-OTable
- Android app that displays the time complexity of common data structures and sorting algorithms. Similar to the Big O cheat sheet (http://bigocheatsheet.com).
-	Implemented links in each data structure and sorting algorithm that takes users to useful videos and sites which lets them learn more about the topic
- Used different colors for running times to let the users visually see which running times are better or worse. In this case, red filled boxes are algorithms that run slower and green filled boxes are algorithms that run faster
